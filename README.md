# config-files
A set of small utilities functions that I find useful

# Target OS
Most of functions should work on Linux, OSX and Termux

# How to Install
Just create a macro 'CONFIG_FILES_DIR' with the path of this project.

You can also use [gil-install](https://github.com/adrianogil/gil-tools/blob/master/src/python/gil_install.py)
```
cd <path-to-config-files>
gil-install -i
```
